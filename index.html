    <p>You need to provide training and instructions to your employees to ensure that they are able to carry out their tasks safely and without risks to health. 
<br><br>
    Training is helping and showing employees what they should and should not do when they carry out their workplace activities. 
    <br><br>
    Employees should be suitably trained in all aspects of their job from the most menial to the riskiest activities in the workplace.
    <br><br>
    Suitable employee training can reduce workplace incidents and accidents which in turn can lead to reduced costs, lower insurance premiums and fewer potential lawsuits. It would also promote a healthier, safer and happier workforce. 
    <br><br>
    Workplace instruction can be carried out in various ways, it could be a written document such as a method statement, or it could be verbal communication from a line manager or colleague.</p>

    <h2>2. Types of workplace training</h2>
    <h3>Induction training</h3>
    <p>Induction training is provided for new employees to help them to settle into the new workplace environment and activities.</p><p>This basic training will give the new employees an outline of the organisation and the services it provides.</p><p>It will assist employees to become familiar with their new workplace environment, colleagues and procedures.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some of the topics you should provide in induction training could be</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>workplace orientation</li>
        <li>fire safety and emergency procedures</li>
        <li>first aid</li><li>health and safety (such as risk assessments or accident reporting procedure)<br></li>
        <li>welfare facilities</li>

        <li>risk assessments</li>
        <li>maintenance or storage of personal protective equipment.</li>
    </ul>

   
    <h3>Refresher training</h3>
    <p>
        Refresher training is given to employees on the assumption that existing skills have become out-dated or obsolete. This could be because of the advancement of technology or simply that people can forget things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Employees could become complacent with safety procedures which could lead to mistakes or errors, for this reason, it is important to refresh employees knowledge and skills.
    </p>

<h3>Toolbox talks</h3>
<p>
    A toolbox talk is an informal workplace safety meeting. These are intended to communicate vital safety information to employees. The talks will help facilitate health and safety discussions and will promote a positive safety culture within the organisation.
</p>
<p>
    he talks focus on various safety topics that are related to any specific workplace activity. For example, you can use them to deal with
</p>

<ul>
    <li>hazards</li>
    <li>safe systems of work</li>
    <li>risk assessments</li>
    <li>training needs</li>
    <li>health and safety updates</li>
    <li>incidents and accident investigation updates</li>
    <li>new equipment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The talks can be done face-to-face, at shift handovers, planned huddles or in a short presentation. They are often kept short and can be carried out by managers, supervisors or even fellow workplace colleagues.
</p>
    <p>
        The talks can be more informal than other types of training but you can also keep a record of them.

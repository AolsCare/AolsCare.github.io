    <p>You need to provide training and instructions to your employees to ensure that they are able to carry out their tasks safely and without risks to health. 
<br><br>
    Training is helping and showing employees what they should and should not do when they carry out their workplace activities. 
    <br><br>
    Employees should be suitably trained in all aspects of their job from the most menial to the riskiest activities in the workplace.
    <br><br>
    Suitable employee training can reduce workplace incidents and accidents which in turn can lead to reduced costs, lower insurance premiums and fewer potential lawsuits. It would also promote a healthier, safer and happier workforce. 
    <br><br>
    Workplace instruction can be carried out in various ways, it could be a written document such as a method statement, or it could be verbal communication from a line manager or colleague.</p>
